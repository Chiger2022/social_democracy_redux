= Second Italo-Ethiopian War

Italian forces have invaded Ethiopia from Eritrea, sparking a war between the two states. This comes following a prior crisis where Italian forces, operating a garrison well within Ethiopian territory, refused to cooperate with an Anglo-Ethiopian survey of the region and, after a standoff, attacked the Ethiopian encampment.
